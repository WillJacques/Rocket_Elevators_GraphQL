## What id GraphQL
​
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data.
​
Once a GraphQL service is running (typically at a URL on a web service), it can receive GraphQL queries to validate and execute
​
## Week 8
Our **GraphQL API** is deployed on **Heroku** service and we have used :
​
 - **Express**
 - **Apollo**
​


And the language we have used to create this API was :


- **TypeScript**

-The **express**-**graphql** module provides a simple way to create an **Express** server that runs a **GraphQL** API.

-**Apollo** is the industry-standard GraphQL implementation, providing the data graph layer that connects modern apps to the cloud. 

-Queries are in GraphQLQueries.

-Procedure for postgres is in ProcedurePostgres folder
